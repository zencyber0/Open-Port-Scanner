# Open-Port-Scanner

To run this, ensure you have pip installed all requirements (found in requirements.txt) if your unaware about how that works. 

To pip install, do pretty obvious... pip install {requirement} 
Do that in cmd prompt. 
Ensure you have python installed aswell since this is a piece of python code.

This is just a repository for a big bigger project called NVS - {Network Vulnerability Scanner}

Thank you.
